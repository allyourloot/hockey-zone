# Puck Trail System

The puck trail system has been successfully implemented to make the puck easier to track during gameplay!

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Core Trail System
- **PuckTrailEffect** (`classes/entities/PuckTrailEffect.ts`) - Handles spawning and managing individual trail particles
- **PuckTrailManager** (`classes/managers/PuckTrailManager.ts`) - Manages the trail effect lifecycle and integration
- **Trail Constants** - Added to `classes/utils/constants.ts` for easy configuration

### Visual Effects
- **Custom gradient trail** with white-to-gray fade that follows the puck when it moves **freely** (not controlled by players)
- Particles spawn only when:
  - The puck is NOT being controlled by a player
  - The puck is moving fast enough (configurable speed threshold)
- Trail appears during shots, passes, and deflections - making it easier to track fast-moving pucks
- Trail disappears when a player gains control of the puck
- **Smooth gradient plane particles** provide elegant visual guidance without being distracting
- Trail has a maximum length to prevent performance issues
- Particles automatically clean up after a set lifetime

### Chat Commands
- `/spawnpuck` - Spawns a new puck with trail effect at center ice
- `/removetrail` - Removes the current trail effect
- `/trailcolor <red|gold>` - Preview command for future color switching

## ⚙️ Configuration

Trail behavior can be adjusted in `classes/utils/constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const PUCK_TRAIL = {
  MAX_LENGTH: 15,              // Maximum number of trail particles
  SPAWN_INTERVAL: 50,          // Milliseconds between particle spawns
  PARTICLE_LIFETIME: 800,      // How long particles last (ms)
  MIN_SPEED_FOR_TRAIL: 2.0,    // Minimum puck speed to show trail
  PARTICLE_SCALE: 0.3,         // Size of trail particles
  POSITION_RANDOMNESS: 0.2     // Random spread of particles
}
```

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Automatic Activation**: Trail is automatically attached when pucks are spawned
2. **Speed-Based**: Trail only appears when the puck is moving fast enough
3. **Performance Optimized**: Limited particle count and automatic cleanup
4. **Memory Safe**: Particles are properly despawned to prevent memory leaks

## 🔧 Integration Points

The trail system is integrated with:
- **ChatCommandManager** - Handles trail commands and puck spawning
- **PlayerManager** - Attaches trail to initial puck spawns
- **Main Game Loop** - Runs at ~60 FPS for smooth trail updates

## 🎨 Future Enhancements

- Team-based trail colors (red for one team, blue for another)
- Dynamic trail intensity based on puck speed
- Different particle effects for different game states
- Trail customization options for players

## 🚀 Usage

The trail system is fully automatic! Just spawn a puck and start moving it around:

1. Use `/spawnpuck` to create a puck with trail
2. **Control the puck** - Notice NO trail appears while you're controlling it
3. **Take a shot or pass** - Watch the elegant gradient trail appear as the puck flies free
4. **Regain control** - Trail disappears when you pick up the puck again
5. Use `/removetrail` if you want to disable the effect

## 🎯 When You'll See the Trail

- ✅ **During shots** - After releasing a shot, trail helps track the puck's path
- ✅ **During passes** - Trail shows the puck's trajectory to teammates  
- ✅ **After deflections** - When puck bounces off players or walls
- ✅ **Free-flying puck** - Any time the puck is moving without player control
- ❌ **While controlling** - No trail when you have the puck on your stick

This smart behavior ensures the trail only appears when it's most helpful - during fast-moving plays where tracking the puck is challenging!
