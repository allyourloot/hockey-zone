# Phase 1: Coordinate-Based Goal Detection - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of Phase 1 of the coordinate-based goal scoring system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. GoalDetectionService (`classes/services/GoalDetectionService.ts`)
- **Core Logic**: Monitors puck position and detects goal line crossings
- **Goal Zones**: Based on your measured coordinates:
  - **Red Goal**: Z = -31.285, X width: -1.17 to 1.16
  - **Blue Goal**: Z = 31.26, X width: -1.17 to 1.16
- **Detection Method**: Compares previous and current puck positions to detect line crossing
- **Safety Features**: 
  - 2-second cooldown between goals
  - Only active during `IN_PERIOD` game state
  - Height validation (Y: 0.5 to 3.0)
  - Width validation (X within goal posts)

### 2. Integration with Main Game Loop (`index.ts`)
- **Monitoring Loop**: Checks for goals every 50ms (20 times per second)
- **Service Initialization**: Starts monitoring when server starts
- **Goal Processing**: Calls `HockeyGameManager.goalScored()` when detected

### 3. Debug Commands (`classes/managers/ChatCommandManager.ts`)
- `/startmatch` - Force start match for testing
- `/goalinfo` - Show goal detection status and puck position
- `/testgoal <red|blue>` - Manually trigger goals for testing
- `/resetgoals` - Reset goal detection service state

## How It Works

### Goal Detection Algorithm
1. **Position Tracking**: Service stores previous puck position each frame
2. **Line Crossing**: Checks if puck Z coordinate crossed goal line between frames
3. **Validation**: Ensures puck is within goal width (X) and reasonable height (Y)
4. **Team Assignment**: 
   - Puck entering Red Goal (Z < -31.285) = Blue team scores
   - Puck entering Blue Goal (Z > 31.26) = Red team scores

### Integration Flow
```
Main Loop (50ms) ‚Üí GoalDetectionService.checkForGoal() ‚Üí 
  If goal detected ‚Üí HockeyGameManager.goalScored() ‚Üí 
    Chat announcement + Score update + UI notification
```

## Testing Commands

### Basic Testing Workflow
1. **Start Server**: Goal detection automatically starts monitoring
2. **Start Match**: Use `/startmatch` to enable goal detection (sets game state to `IN_PERIOD`)
3. **Check Status**: Use `/goalinfo` to see detection status and puck position
4. **Test Detection**: Shoot puck into goals or use `/testgoal <team>` for manual testing
5. **Debug**: Use `/resetgoals` if needed to clear service state

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Goals should be detected when puck crosses goal lines
- ‚úÖ Chat messages should announce goals: "GOAL! [TEAM] team scores! Score is now RED X - BLUE Y"
- ‚úÖ Scores should be tracked and displayed
- ‚úÖ 2-second cooldown should prevent spam detection
- ‚úÖ No goals should be detected outside of `IN_PERIOD` state

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `classes/services/GoalDetectionService.ts` - Core goal detection logic

### Modified Files
- `index.ts` - Added service initialization and monitoring loop
- `classes/managers/ChatCommandManager.ts` - Added debug commands

## Next Steps for Phase 2
1. **Player Spawn System**: Create position-specific spawn points
2. **Goal Reset Sequence**: Reset players and puck after goals
3. **Enhanced Game Flow**: Improve transitions between game states

## Troubleshooting

### If Goals Aren't Being Detected
1. Check game state with `/goalinfo` - must be "ACTIVE"
2. Use `/startmatch` if state is not IN_PERIOD
3. Verify puck position is within goal coordinates
4. Check console logs for detection attempts

### If Goals Are Detected Multiple Times
- Service has 2-second cooldown built-in
- Use `/resetgoals` to clear any stuck state
- Check that puck isn't bouncing on goal line repeatedly

This Phase 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for coordinate-based goal detection that should be much more reliable than collision sensors.

# Phase 2: Player Spawn System - COMPLETED! üéâ

## What Was Added in Phase 2

### 1. PlayerSpawnManager (`classes/managers/PlayerSpawnManager.ts`)
- **Spawn Coordinates**: Based on your exact measured positions for each role
- **Team-Specific Positions**: Red and Blue team formations
- **Complete Reset System**: Teleports all players and resets puck after goals
- **Validation**: Ensures all spawn positions are properly configured

### 2. Enhanced Goal Scoring Flow (`classes/managers/HockeyGameManager.ts`)
- **Automatic Reset**: After goals, players are automatically moved to spawn positions
- **Puck Reset**: Puck returns to center ice after goals
- **Countdown System**: 3-second countdown before resuming play
- **Smooth Transitions**: Goal celebration ‚Üí Reset ‚Üí Countdown ‚Üí Resume play

### 3. Additional Debug Commands (`classes/managers/ChatCommandManager.ts`)
- `/resetplayers` - Manually reset all players to spawn positions
- `/spawninfo` - Show your assigned spawn position coordinates

## Spawn Positions Implemented

### Red Team
- **GOALIE**: x: 0, y: 1.75, z: -29 (in front of red goal)
- **DEFENDER1**: x: 10.11, y: 1.75, z: -6.21
- **DEFENDER2**: x: -10.11, y: 1.75, z: -6.21
- **WINGER1**: x: 10.11, y: 1.75, z: -0.30
- **WINGER2**: x: -10.11, y: 1.75, z: -0.30
- **CENTER**: x: 0.05, y: 1.75, z: -1.30

### Blue Team
- **GOALIE**: x: 0, y: 1.75, z: 29 (in front of blue goal)
- **DEFENDER1**: x: -10.11, y: 1.75, z: 8
- **DEFENDER2**: x: 10.11, y: 1.75, z: 8
- **WINGER1**: x: -10.11, y: 1.75, z: 1.76
- **WINGER2**: x: 10.11, y: 1.75, z: 1.76
- **CENTER**: x: 0.05, y: 1.75, z: 3.30

## New Goal Scoring Flow
1. **Goal Detected** ‚Üí Chat announcement + score update
2. **3-Second Celebration** ‚Üí Players can celebrate
3. **Complete Reset** ‚Üí All players teleported to spawn positions + puck to center ice
4. **3-Second Countdown** ‚Üí "Resuming play in 3... 2... 1..."
5. **Play Resumed** ‚Üí Game continues normally

## Testing Phase 2
- Use `/startmatch` to enable goal detection
- Score a goal and watch the automatic reset sequence
- Use `/resetplayers` to manually test the spawn system
- Use `/spawninfo` to see your assigned spawn position

**Phase 2 Complete!** The hockey game now has a complete goal scoring and reset system! üèí‚ú®
