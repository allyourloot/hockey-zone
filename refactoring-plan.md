# Hockey Zone Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the methodical refactoring of `index.ts` into smaller, focused modules while preserving all existing functionality. The refactoring will be done in phases to minimize risk and ensure each step can be tested independently.

## Current Structure Analysis

### Existing Sections in `index.ts`:
1. **IMPORTS & TYPE DEFINITIONS** - All SDK imports and type definitions
2. **MAP & WORLD INITIALIZATION** - World setup, model registry, and hockey goals creation
3. **PLAYER MANAGEMENT** - Join/leave events, team assignment, lock-in system
4. **CHAT COMMANDS** - All chat command handlers
5. **PLAYER ENTITY & COLLIDERS** - Player entity creation and collider setup
6. **ICESKATINGCONTROLLER** - Complete ice skating controller with all hockey mechanics
7. **GAME MANAGER INITIALIZATION** - HockeyGameManager setup
8. **MISCELLANEOUS/UTILITY** - Utility functions
9. **AUDIO MANAGEMENT** - Ambient sounds, music, and SFX scheduling

- ✅ Move crowd chant and percussion beat logic
- ✅ Move background music initialization
- ✅ Implement singleton pattern for global access
- ✅ Add proper error handling and logging

#### 2.2 ✅ Update index.ts to use AudioManager
- ✅ Import and initialize AudioManager
- ✅ Remove audio management code from index.ts
- ✅ Simplified audio initialization to single line

#### 2.3 ✅ Test Phase 2
- ✅ Verify audio manager initializes correctly
- ✅ Confirm background music plays
- ✅ Test ambient sound scheduling works
- ✅ Ensure no audio-related errors

## Phase 3: Chat Commands System (Low Risk) - COMPLETED ✅
**Goal**: Extract chat command management to dedicated manager

#### 3.1 ✅ Create ChatCommandManager class
- ✅ **File**: `classes/managers/ChatCommandManager.ts` - Extract all chat commands
- ✅ Move /rocket, /puck, /spawnpuck, /testsleep commands
- ✅ Add proper command registration system
- ✅ Handle puck reference sharing between main code and command manager
- ✅ Use constants for spawn positions

#### 3.2 ✅ Update index.ts to use ChatCommandManager
- ✅ Import and initialize ChatCommandManager
- ✅ Remove chat command code from index.ts
- ✅ Replace ~50 lines of chat command code with single initialization line

#### 3.3 ✅ Test Phase 3
- ✅ Test all commands work correctly
- ✅ Verify /rocket command applies impulse to players
- ✅ Verify /puck command shows debug information
- ✅ Verify /spawnpuck command creates new puck
- ✅ Verify /testsleep command triggers animations

## Phase 4: World Initialization System (Medium Risk) - COMPLETED ✅
**Goal**: Extract world setup and entity creation to dedicated system

#### 4.1 ✅ Create WorldInitializer class
- ✅ **File**: `classes/systems/WorldInitializer.ts` - Extract world setup logic
- ✅ Move map loading and model registry configuration
- ✅ Move hockey goal creation and positioning
- ✅ Move puck entity creation helper function
- ✅ Add proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Implement singleton pattern for global access
- ✅ Create dedicated goal entity factory with all colliders

#### 4.2 ✅ Update index.ts to use WorldInitializer
- ✅ Import and initialize WorldInitializer
- ✅ Remove world initialization code from index.ts
- ✅ Replace ~200 lines of world setup code with single initialization line
- ✅ Maintain puck reference sharing

#### 4.3 ✅ Test Phase 4
- ✅ Verify world loads correctly
- ✅ Test hockey goals spawn with proper colliders
- ✅ Test puck creation and spawning
- ✅ Ensure no world initialization errors
- 📝 Note: ModelRegistry line temporarily kept in index.ts due to model optimization issues

## Phase 5: Player Management System (High Risk) - ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Extract player join/leave handling and team management

#### 5.1 ✅ Create PlayerManager class
- ✅ **File**: `classes/managers/PlayerManager.ts` - Extract player lifecycle management
- ✅ Move player join/leave event handlers
- ✅ Move team assignment and lock-in logic
- ✅ Move player entity creation and setup
- ✅ Handle UI event processing (team selection, puck pass/shoot, lock-in)
- ✅ Move puck spawning logic
- ✅ Maintain puck reference sharing for ChatCommandManager
- ✅ Add proper error handling and logging

#### 5.2 ✅ Update index.ts to use PlayerManager
- ✅ Import and initialize PlayerManager
- ✅ Remove player management code from index.ts (~267 lines removed)
- ✅ Maintain integration with HockeyGameManager
- ✅ Initialize after IceSkatingController class definition
- ✅ Pass IceSkatingController reference to PlayerManager

- ✅ Maintain static properties and global state
- 🟡 **PARTIAL**: Main tickWithPlayerInput method uses placeholder (needs full extraction)

#### 6.2 ✅ Update index.ts to use extracted controller
- ✅ Import IceSkatingController from new file
- ✅ Remove class definition from index.ts (~1500+ lines)
- ✅ Ensure PlayerManager can still access controller class
- ✅ Clean, minimal index.ts structure

#### 6.3 🟡 Test Phase 6

- [ ] Test puck control and manipulation (should work)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Test hockey stops, spins, and special moves (needs full tickWithPlayerInput)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Test body checks and stick checks (needs full tickWithPlayerInput)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Test audio effects and animations (needs full tickWithPlayerInput)

**Lines Reduced**: 1505 lines (1655 → 150)
**Files Created**: `classes/controllers/IceSkatingController.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Basic extraction completed, 🟡 Full implementation pending

## Risk Assessment

### ✅ Low Risk Areas (Phase 1):
- **Constants/Types**: Pure utility extractions - COMPLETED

### Upcoming Medium Risk Areas:
- **Audio Manager**: Timing-sensitive sound scheduling  
- **World Initialization**: Entity creation and physics setup

### Upcoming High Risk Areas:
- **IceSkatingController**: Most complex with many interdependencies
- **Player Management**: Critical for game functionality
- **Puck Control System**: Complex state management

## Testing Strategy

### ✅ Phase 1 Testing:
- [x] Constants properly extracted and organized
- [x] Types properly defined and exported  
- [ ] **PENDING**: Import structure updated in index.ts
- [ ] **PENDING**: Server starts without issues
- [ ] **PENDING**: Goal colliders use constants correctly
- [ ] **PENDING**: No compilation errors

### Critical Test Cases for Phase 1:
- Server startup successful
- Goals spawn with correct collider properties using constants
- Puck creation uses physics constants
- No TypeScript compilation errors
