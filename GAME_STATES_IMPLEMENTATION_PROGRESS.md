# Hockey Zone Game States Implementation - Progress Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the complete game state system for Hockey Zone while preserving all existing mechanics.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Match Start System âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Goals Achieved
- **Enhanced `/startmatch` Command**: Now triggers proper game start sequence instead of direct state change
- **Complete Match Reset**: All players reset to spawn positions and puck to center ice
- **Movement Lock During Reset**: Players locked in position during reset sequence
- **Dynamic Countdown UI**: "Game starting in 3...2...1...GO!" with proper subtitle support
- **Proper State Management**: Clean transitions from LOBBY â†’ MATCH_START â†’ IN_PERIOD

### âœ… Files Modified

#### 1. **classes/managers/ChatCommandManager.ts**
- **Updated `/startmatch` command** to call `startMatchSequence()` instead of direct methods
- **Added `/testgamestart` debug command** for easy testing of new sequence

#### 2. **classes/managers/HockeyGameManager.ts**
- **Added `startMatchSequence()` method** - Main entry point for match start
  - Sets state to MATCH_START (locks movement)
  - Resets period to 1 and scores to 0-0
  - Calls match reset and countdown
- **Added `performMatchReset()` method** - Handles complete game reset
  - Uses existing PlayerSpawnManager for consistency
  - Resets all players to spawn positions
  - Resets puck to center ice
  - Updates UI with score/period reset
- **Added `startGameCountdown()` method** - Game start countdown
  - 3-2-1-GO countdown with "Game Starting" subtitle
  - Unlocks movement after countdown
  - Starts period timer automatically
  - Consistent with existing goal reset countdown
- **Added `getValidTeamsForReset()` helper method** - Type-safe team conversion
- **Updated `startResumeCountdown()`** - Added subtitle support for consistency

#### 3. **assets/ui/index.html**
- **Enhanced countdown UI handling** - Support for dynamic subtitles
- **Updated `showCountdownOverlay()` function** - Accepts subtitle parameter
- **Updated countdown data handler** - Passes subtitle from server to UI

### âœ… How It Works

#### Match Start Sequence Flow:
1. **Command Trigger**: `/startmatch` or `/testgamestart` 
2. **State Lock**: Game state â†’ MATCH_START (movement locked)
3. **Reset Scores**: Period â†’ 1, Scores â†’ RED 0 - BLUE 0
4. **Complete Reset**: All players â†’ spawn positions, Puck â†’ center ice
5. **UI Updates**: Scoreboard shows 0-0, 1st Period
6. **Countdown Start**: "Game starting in 3...2...1...GO!" overlay
7. **Game Start**: State â†’ IN_PERIOD (movement unlocked), Period timer starts

#### Key Features:
- **Movement Lock**: Players can't move during reset and countdown (like goal reset)
- **Consistent UI**: Uses same countdown overlay as goal resets, just different subtitle
- **Complete Reset**: Both players and puck reset to proper positions
- **Automatic Timer**: Period timer starts automatically after countdown
- **State Safety**: Proper state validation prevents duplicate sequences
- **Preserve Mechanics**: All existing gameplay mechanics unchanged

### âœ… Testing
- **Command**: Use `/startmatch` for production-like experience
- **Debug Command**: Use `/testgamestart` for testing the sequence
- **Expected Behavior**:
  1. Players freeze in position (MOVEMENT LOCKED)
  2. All players teleport to spawn positions
  3. Puck resets to center ice
  4. Scoreboard shows 0-0, 1st Period
  5. "Game starting in 3...2...1...GO!" countdown overlay
  6. Players can move after "GO!" (MOVEMENT UNLOCKED)
  7. Period timer starts running
  8. Goal detection is active

### âœ… **FIXED: Movement Lock Issue**
- **Problem**: Movement wasn't locked during match start countdown like it is during goal resets
- **Root Cause**: `IceSkatingController` only checked for `GOAL_SCORED` state, not `MATCH_START` state
- **Solution**: Updated movement lock check to include both `GOAL_SCORED` and `MATCH_START` states
- **Result**: Players now properly frozen during match start countdown, exactly like goal resets

## Phase 2: Period Management System âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Goals Achieved
- **Enhanced `endPeriod()` Logic**: Complete period transition system with proper sequencing
- **Period Break Overlays**: Beautiful "End of [X] Period" UI with scores display
- **Period Start Sequences**: Dynamic "[X] Period starting in 3...2...1...GO!" countdown
- **Automatic Player Reset**: Players teleport to spawn positions between periods
- **Proper State Management**: Clean PERIOD_END â†’ MATCH_START â†’ IN_PERIOD transitions
- **Movement Lock During Reset**: Players frozen during period transitions (just like goal resets)

### âœ… Files Modified

#### 1. **classes/managers/HockeyGameManager.ts**
- **Enhanced `endPeriod()` method**: Now triggers proper period break sequence
- **New `startPeriodBreak()` method**: Handles "End of Period" overlay and timing
- **New `startNextPeriodSequence()` method**: Manages transition to next period
- **New `performPeriodReset()` method**: Resets all players and puck for new period
- **New `startPeriodCountdown()` method**: Dynamic countdown with period-specific subtitles
- **New `getPeriodName()` helper**: Formats period names (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

#### 2. **assets/ui/index.html**
- **Period Break Overlay HTML**: New overlay with period text and score display
- **Period Break CSS**: Beautiful styling with animations and team color support
- **Period Break JavaScript**: `showPeriodBreakOverlay()` and `hidePeriodBreakOverlay()` functions
- **UI Message Handlers**: Support for `period-end` and `period-end-hide` events

#### 3. **classes/managers/ChatCommandManager.ts**
- **`/testperiodend` command**: Debug command to test period transition sequences

### âœ… Testing
- **Command**: Use `/testperiodend` to test period transitions
- **Expected Sequence**:
  1. "End of [X] Period" overlay appears with current scores
  2. Overlay shows for 4 seconds
  3. Players freeze and teleport to spawn positions
  4. "[Next Period] starting in 3...2...1...GO!" countdown
  5. Players unlocked, period timer starts
  6. Scoreboard updates to new period
- **Automatic Progression**: 1st â†’ 2nd â†’ 3rd â†’ Game Over

### âœ… Timer Synchronization Fixed
- **Issue**: Period timer wasn't automatically triggering `endPeriod()` when UI timer expired
- **Fix**: Added `handlePeriodEnd()` method in PlayerManager to handle UI `period-end` events
- **Issue**: Scoreboard timer wasn't resetting during period transitions  
- **Fix**: Added `timer-restart` event to reset UI timer when new periods start
- **Result**: Server and UI timers now properly synchronized for automatic period transitions

## Phase 3: Game Over System ðŸš§ PLANNED

## Key Implementation Notes

### âœ… Design Principles Followed
- **Non-Destructive**: All existing mechanics preserved
- **Consistent UX**: Reused existing countdown and UI patterns
- **Robust State Management**: Proper validation and error handling
- **Extensible**: Built foundation for future phases

### âœ… Architecture Decisions
- **Reused PlayerSpawnManager**: Consistent with existing reset logic
- **Extended Countdown System**: Built upon goal reset countdown
- **Modular Methods**: Each phase of match start in separate methods
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types and validation

## Phase 2.1: Period Transition Movement Lock & Puck Reset Fix âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Issues Identified & Fixed
1. **Players not resetting to spawn positions** during period transitions
2. **Movement not locked** during period transitions (unlike goal resets)
3. **Puck control maintained** through period transitions
4. **Period resets not behaving like goal resets**

### âœ… Solutions Implemented

#### 1. **classes/controllers/IceSkatingController.ts**
- **Added `PERIOD_END` to movement lock check**: Updated condition to include `HockeyGameState.PERIOD_END`
- **Result**: Players now properly frozen during period transitions

#### 2. **classes/managers/HockeyGameManager.ts**
- **Enhanced `startNextPeriodSequence()`**: Added `_state = HockeyGameState.PERIOD_END` to lock movement
- **Enhanced `performPeriodReset()`**: 
  - Gets actual puck entity from `ChatCommandManager.instance.getPuck()`
  - Passes real puck entity to `performCompleteReset()` instead of `null`
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Result**: Period transitions now behave exactly like goal resets

### âœ… How It Works Now

#### Period Transition Flow:
1. **Period Ends**: Timer expires or `/testperiodend` command
2. **Period Break**: "End of [X] Period" overlay with scores (4 seconds)
3. **Movement Lock**: State â†’ PERIOD_END (players frozen)
4. **Complete Reset**: All players â†’ spawn positions, Puck detached & reset to center ice
5. **Next Period Countdown**: "[X] Period starting in 3...2...1...GO!" overlay
6. **Period Start**: State â†’ IN_PERIOD (movement unlocked), Timer starts

#### Key Fixes:
- **Movement Lock**: Players can't move during period transitions (same as goal resets)
- **Puck Release**: Puck automatically detached from controlling player
- **Player Reset**: All players teleported to proper spawn positions
- **Puck Reset**: Puck placed at center ice with zero velocity
- **State Consistency**: Uses same reset logic as goal scoring system

### âœ… Testing
- **Command**: Use `/testperiodend` to test period transitions
- **Expected Behavior**:
  1. "End of [X] Period" overlay appears
  2. Players freeze in position (MOVEMENT LOCKED)
  3. All players teleport to spawn positions
  4. Puck detaches and resets to center ice
  5. "[Next Period] starting in 3...2...1...GO!" countdown
  6. Players can move after "GO!" (MOVEMENT UNLOCKED)
  7. Period timer starts for new period

### âœ… Result
**Period transitions now behave exactly like goal resets** with proper movement lock, player spawn reset, and puck release/reset to center ice.

## Phase 2.2: Referee Whistle Sound Effect âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Feature Added
Added authentic referee whistle sound effect that plays when "GO!" appears during all countdown sequences.

### âœ… Implementation Details

#### 1. **classes/utils/constants.ts**
- **Added `REFEREE_WHISTLE` constant**: Points to `'audio/sfx/hockey/referee-whistle.mp3'`

#### 2. **classes/managers/HockeyGameManager.ts**
- **Added Audio import**: Imported `Audio` from 'hytopia'
- **Created `playRefereeWhistle()` method**: 
  - Gets all players from both teams
  - Plays whistle sound for each player with proper entity attachment
  - Volume set to 0.6 for appropriate level
  - Includes error handling for missing entities/worlds
- **Added whistle calls to all "GO!" moments**:
  - Goal reset countdown â†’ "Play resumed!"
  - Game start countdown â†’ "Game started! GO!"
  - Period start countdown â†’ "[Period] started! GO!"

### âœ… How It Works

#### Sound Effect Timing:
1. **Countdown**: "3...2...1..." (no sound)
2. **"GO!" Appears**: Referee whistle plays simultaneously âœ… **NEW**
3. **Movement Unlocked**: Players can move
4. **Play Begins**: Game continues

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Multi-player Support**: Sound plays for all players simultaneously
- **Entity Attachment**: Sound attached to each player's entity for proper spatial audio
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if player entities not found
- **Consistent Volume**: 0.6 volume level for all whistle sounds
- **Proper Timing**: Plays exactly when "GO!" overlay appears

### âœ… Testing
- **Commands**: Use `/startmatch`, `/testgamestart`, or `/testperiodend`
- **Expected Behavior**: Sharp referee whistle sound plays exactly when "GO!" text appears on screen
- **All Sequences**: Works for goal resets, match start, and period transitions

### âœ… Result
**Authentic hockey atmosphere** with referee whistle sound effect playing at all "GO!" moments, enhancing the professional feel of game state transitions.

## Additional Fixes Applied: Waiting State & Game Reset âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Issues Fixed
1. **Waiting State Display**: Scoreboard showed "1st Period" even when in lobby/waiting state
2. **Clock Display**: Timer was running during waiting state instead of showing "--:--"
3. **Game Reset**: After game over, players weren't returned to team selection
4. **Player Count**: No real-time updates of connected players in waiting state

### âœ… Solutions Implemented

#### 1. **classes/managers/PlayerManager.ts**
- **Enhanced `setupPlayerUI()`**: Now checks game state and sends appropriate UI data
- **Added `game-waiting` event**: New event type for waiting state with player count
- **Enhanced `updateGameState()`**: Broadcasts waiting state updates to all players
- **Added player join/leave updates**: Triggers waiting state updates when players connect/disconnect

#### 2. **classes/managers/HockeyGameManager.ts**

#### 4. **classes/managers/ChatCommandManager.ts**
- **Added `/resetgame` command**: Debug command to manually reset game to lobby

### âœ… How It Works Now

#### Waiting State Flow:
1. **Player Joins**: Game checks current state and player count
2. **Waiting State UI**: If in lobby/waiting, shows:
   - "Waiting for players X/12" instead of period
   - "--:--" instead of running timer
   - Current scores (0-0)
3. **Real-time Updates**: Player count updates as players join/leave
4. **Match Start**: When all positions locked in, transitions to normal game UI

#### Game Over Reset Flow:
1. **Game Over**: Enhanced overlay shows for 10 seconds
2. **Complete Reset**: All game state cleared (teams, scores, stats, timers)
3. **Team Selection**: Players returned to team selection overlay
4. **Fresh Start**: Players can reselect teams for new game

### âœ… Key Features
- **Smart UI State**: UI adapts based on actual game state (waiting vs playing)
- **Player Count Display**: Real-time "X/12 players" counter in waiting state
- **Complete Reset**: Full game reset preserves no previous state
- **Team Selection Reset**: Players can choose different teams after game over
- **Proper State Management**: Clean transitions between lobby and game states

### âœ… Testing Commands
- `/resetgame` - Manually reset game to lobby (for testing)
