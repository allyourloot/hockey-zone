## 🏒 How Offside Detection Works

### **Detection Logic**
1. **Puck Tracking**: Monitors puck crossing blue lines at Z = -6.5 and 7.5
2. **Player History**: Tracks last 5 seconds of player positions (10 positions per player)
3. **Violation Check**: When puck enters offensive zone, checks if any attacking team players were already there
4. **Faceoff Location**: Automatically determines appropriate faceoff spot in neutral zone

### **Game Flow**
1. 🔵 Puck crosses blue line into offensive zone
2. ⚠️ System checks if attacking players were already in zone
3. 🎺 **OFFSIDE!** - Referee whistle blows immediately  
4. 📺 Orange "OFFSIDE!" overlay shows for 3 seconds
5. 🏃 Players/puck teleport to faceoff positions
6. ⏰ 3-second countdown: "3... 2... 1... GO!"
7. ▶️ Play resumes

## 🎮 Debug Commands Available

### **Control Commands**
- `/startoffside` - Start offside monitoring
- `/stopoffside` - Stop offside monitoring
- `/resetoffside` - Reset service state

### **Debug/Info Commands**  
- `/debugoffside` - Show detection status and zone boundaries
- `/offsideinfo` - Detailed debug information
- `/myzone` - Check what zone you're currently in
- `/faceoffspots` - Show all faceoff location coordinates

### **Testing Commands**
- `/testoffside RED RED_NEUTRAL_LEFT` - Simulate Red team violation
- `/testoffside BLUE BLUE_NEUTRAL_RIGHT` - Simulate Blue team violation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Zone Boundaries** (from your map analysis)
- **Red Defensive**: Z < -6.5 
- **Neutral Zone**: -6.5 ≤ Z ≤ 7.5
- **Blue Defensive**: Z > 7.5

### **Faceoff Locations** (based on your red dots)
```
RED_DEFENSIVE_LEFT:   (-14, 1.75, -23)
RED_DEFENSIVE_RIGHT:  (15, 1.75, -23)
RED_NEUTRAL_LEFT:     (-14, 1.75, -4)
RED_NEUTRAL_RIGHT:    (15, 1.75, -4)
BLUE_NEUTRAL_LEFT:    (-14, 1.75, 21)
BLUE_NEUTRAL_RIGHT:   (15, 1.75, 21)
BLUE_DEFENSIVE_LEFT:  (-14, 1.75, 5)
BLUE_DEFENSIVE_RIGHT: (15, 1.75, 5)
```

### **Performance**
- Offside detection: Every 100ms (10 FPS)
- Player position tracking: Real-time
- 3-second cooldown between violations
- Ignores puck teleports (distance > 10 blocks)

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

The offside detection system is now **fully integrated** and ready for testing! 

### **To Start Testing:**
1. Start your server normally
2. Use `/startoffside` command to enable detection
3. Try skating offside and see the system in action!
4. Use debug commands to monitor and test

### **Expected Behavior:**
- Players skating ahead of puck into offensive zone → **OFFSIDE!**
- Immediate whistle + overlay
- Automatic faceoff positioning
- Smooth countdown and play resumption

The system follows real hockey offside rules and provides a professional experience with proper UI, audio, and game flow! 🏆
