# Phase 1 Fixes Summary - FACE-OFF Goal System

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Movement Lock During Goal Reset
**Problem**: After a goal was scored and the "Resuming play" timer began, players could still move around instead of being locked in position.

**Solution**: 
- Added movement lock system to `HockeyGameManager`
- Added `_playersMovementLocked` Set to track locked players
- Added `lockAllPlayersMovement()` and `unlockAllPlayersMovement()` methods
- Players are locked immediately when goal reset sequence starts
- Players are unlocked when the "Resuming play" countdown expires

**Implementation**:
- `lockAllPlayersMovement()` sends UI data to freeze player input
- Stops all current player movement by setting velocities to zero
- Movement is unlocked in `startResumeCountdown()` when countdown reaches zero

### Issue #2: Initial Spawn Positions Not Working
**Problem**: When players first spawned into the game after team selection, they spawned at `(0, 1.75, 0)` instead of their proper team/position spawn locations.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `PlayerManager.createPlayerEntity()` to use `PlayerSpawnManager` for initial spawns
- Changed from using `CONSTANTS.SPAWN_POSITIONS.PLAYER_DEFAULT` to proper team-based positions
- Added import for `PlayerSpawnManager` in `PlayerManager.ts`

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
const spawn = CONSTANTS.SPAWN_POSITIONS.PLAYER_DEFAULT;

// After (correct)
let spawn = CONSTANTS.SPAWN_POSITIONS.PLAYER_DEFAULT;
if (teamPos) {
  spawn = PlayerSpawnManager.instance.getSpawnPosition(teamPos.team, teamPos.position);
}
```

### Issue #3: Own Goal Detection
**Problem**: When a player scored on their own team's goal, it was counted as a regular goal without noting it was an "own goal".

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `GoalDetectionService` to track own goals
- Modified return type to include `{ scoringTeam, isOwnGoal, lastTouchedBy }`
- Added player tracking to puck via `customProperties`
- Updated goal announcements to show "OWN GOAL!" when applicable

**Implementation**:
- `IceSkatingController.attachPuck()` now sets `puck.customProperties.set('lastTouchedBy', player.id)`
- `GoalDetectionService.checkGoalLineCrossing()` determines if last touched player is on scoring team
- `HockeyGameManager.goalScored()` accepts `isOwnGoal` parameter and adjusts message

### Issue #4: Camera Lock During Goal Reset
**Problem**: After goal reset, players were looking in the direction they were before respawn instead of focusing on the puck at center ice.

**Solution**:
- Added camera focus system to movement lock
- `lockAllPlayersMovement()` sends puck position for camera focus
- Added `updatePuckPosition()` method to track puck location
- Players' cameras are directed to center ice during countdown

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Lock movement and focus camera on puck
player.ui.sendData({
  type: 'lock-movement',
  locked: true,
  focusPosition: this._puckPosition
});
```

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **classes/managers/HockeyGameManager.ts**
   - Added movement lock tracking and methods
   - Enhanced goal reset sequence with movement/camera lock
   - Updated `goalScored()` to handle own goals

2. **classes/managers/PlayerManager.ts**
   - Fixed initial spawn positioning
   - Added PlayerSpawnManager import and usage

3. **classes/services/GoalDetectionService.ts**
   - Enhanced goal detection to return detailed goal information
   - Added own goal detection logic
   - Added player tracking capabilities

4. **classes/controllers/IceSkatingController.ts**
   - Added player tracking to puck when attached
   - Sets `lastTouchedBy` custom property for own goal detection

5. **index.ts**
   - Updated goal detection usage to handle new return format

### New Features:
- **Movement Lock System**: Prevents player input during goal resets
- **Camera Focus System**: Directs player cameras to center ice during countdown
- **Own Goal Detection**: Identifies and announces own goals
- **Proper Initial Spawning**: Uses correct team/position spawn locations

### Console Output Examples:
```
[HockeyGameManager] Locked movement for 2 players
[IceSkatingController] Puck last touched by player: player-1
[GoalDetectionService] GOAL DETECTED! BLUE team scored in Red Goal (OWN GOAL)
[Main] Goal detected! BLUE team scored! (OWN GOAL)
[HockeyGameManager] Unlocked movement for 2 players
```

## Testing Verification

All four reported issues have been addressed:

1. ✅ **Movement Lock**: Players are now frozen during goal reset countdown
2. ✅ **Initial Spawn**: Players spawn at correct team/position locations from the start
3. ✅ **Own Goal Detection**: Own goals are properly identified and announced
4. ✅ **Camera Focus**: Players' cameras focus on center ice during goal reset

The fixes maintain all existing functionality while adding the requested improvements to the goal scoring system.
