# Ice Floor Block Entity Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the ice floor Block Entity solution to resolve PuckEntity CCD collision issues with individual floor blocks.

## Problem Statement
- PuckEntity with `ccdEnabled: true` suffers from continuous collisions with individual floor blocks (IDs: 70, 102, 106, 107, 108, 113, 122-146)
- Results in choppy puck movement, constant accelerations/decelerations, and loss of momentum
- Poor gameplay experience due to physics conflicts

## Solution
Create a single, large, invisible Block Entity that replaces all individual floor blocks with custom collision properties optimized for puck interaction.

## ‚úÖ PHASE 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Create the basic Ice Floor Block Entity class and constants

### Completed Items:
- ‚úÖ Created `IceFloorEntity` class (`classes/entities/IceFloorEntity.ts`)
  - Large invisible block entity covering entire rink floor (63x91 blocks)
  - Uses `invisible-block.png` texture for visual transparency
  - Positioned at y=0.1 (just above map floor blocks)
  - Custom physics properties for smooth puck interaction
  - RigidBodyType.FIXED for static floor behavior

- ‚úÖ Added `ICE_FLOOR_PHYSICS` constants (`classes/utils/constants.ts`)
  - Floor dimensions and positioning
  - Custom friction and bounciness values
  - Center position coordinates

- ‚úÖ Added static factory method in `WorldInitializer.createIceFloorEntity()`

## ‚úÖ PHASE 2: Integration (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Integrate ice floor entity into world initialization and add debugging tools

### Completed Items:
- ‚úÖ **World Integration:**
  - Added `iceFloor` property to `WorldInitializer` class
  - Created `createIceFloor()` method in `WorldInitializer`
  - Integrated ice floor spawning into `initialize()` method
  - Added `getIceFloor()` getter method

- ‚úÖ **Debugging Tools:**
  - Added `/icefloor` chat command to check entity status
  - Displays spawn status and position information
  - Integrated into `ChatCommandManager` command registration

- ‚úÖ **Error Handling:**
  - Proper try-catch blocks for ice floor creation
  - Debug logging for successful spawning
  - Error logging for failed creation attempts

### Technical Details:
- Ice floor spawns automatically during world initialization
- Positioned at `{ x: 0, y: 0.1, z: -1 }` to cover the entire rink
- Uses collision groups to interact properly with puck physics
- Invisible texture ensures no visual impact on gameplay

## ‚úÖ PHASE 3: Enhanced Collision Physics (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Implement puck-specific collision optimizations for smooth physics

### Completed Items:
- ‚úÖ **Optimized Ice Floor Physics:**
  - Reduced ice floor friction from 0.05 to 0.01 for smoother gliding
  - Set bounciness to 0.0 to eliminate unwanted bouncing
  - Changed combine rules to MULTIPLY for more predictable behavior
  - Implemented proper CollisionGroup enums instead of raw integers

- ‚úÖ **Puck-Specific Collision Handling:**
  - Added custom collision callback for puck detection
  - Implemented velocity clamping to keep puck on ice surface
  - Smart puck identification based on name and model URI
  - Automatic Y-velocity correction to prevent floating

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Puck Physics Constants:**
  - Reduced puck linear damping from 0.05 to 0.02 for smoother movement
  - Reduced angular damping from 0.8 to 0.6 for more natural spinning
  - Lowered puck friction from 0.2 to 0.02 for ice interaction
  - Reduced puck bounciness from 0.05 to 0.01 for realistic behavior

- ‚úÖ **Advanced Debugging Tools:**
  - Added `/testpuckphysics` command for detailed physics monitoring
  - Reports position, linear velocity, and angular velocity in real-time
  - Console logging for development debugging
  - Enhanced ice floor status reporting

### Technical Improvements:
- **Collision Groups:** Proper BLOCK ‚Üî ENTITY collision setup
- **Combine Rules:** MULTIPLY rules for consistent physics behavior
- **Velocity Management:** Automatic Y-velocity clamping prevents puck floating
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Live physics data for testing and validation

## Current Status: Phase 3 Enhanced ‚úÖ

The ice floor entity now features **ultra-optimized physics** with critical positioning fixes:

### üîß **Critical Fixes Applied:**
- **Fixed velocity API calls** - Using correct `linearVelocity` and `angularVelocity` properties
- **Raised ice floor position** from y=0.1 to y=0.2 to ensure it's above map floor blocks
- **Ultra-low friction** (0.001) for true ice-like behavior
- **Lowered puck spawn** from y=1.1 to y=0.3 to sit properly on ice floor
- **Enhanced collision detection** with improved debugging

### üßä **Physics Configuration:**
- **Ice Floor Friction:** 0.001 (ultra-low for ice behavior)
- **Ice Floor Bounciness:** 0.0 (zero bounce)
- **Ice Floor Position:** y=0.2 (above map floor blocks)
- **Puck Position:** y=0.3 (sits on ice floor)
- **Custom collision callbacks** with velocity clamping

### üîç **Enhanced Testing Commands:**
1. **`/icefloor`** - Verify ice floor entity status and position
2. **`/spawnpuck`** - Spawn a puck to test movement quality  
3. **`/testpuckphysics`** - Monitor real-time puck physics data (FIXED)
4. **`/testcollisions`** - Check if puck is properly positioned relative to ice floor
5. **Test movement** - Puck should now glide smoothly on the ice floor instead of choppy map blocks!

### Key Files Modified:
- `classes/entities/IceFloorEntity.ts` (created)
- `classes/utils/constants.ts` (added ICE_FLOOR_PHYSICS)
- `classes/systems/WorldInitializer.ts` (added ice floor integration)
- `classes/managers/ChatCommandManager.ts` (added debug command)
