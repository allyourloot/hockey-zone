# 🎵 Audio Degradation Fixes Summary

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your audio degradation issue was **exactly diagnosed** by our debugging system:

- **25 unmanaged audio instances** were accumulating in just seconds of gameplay
- **24 entity-attached audios** were not being cleaned up properly  
- **0 managed audios** - all problematic sounds were using direct `new Audio()` creation

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Puck Dangling Optimization** (Primary Fix)
**Issue**: `puck-left.mp3`, `puck-right.mp3`, and `puck-catch.mp3` were spamming during player movement.

**Fix**:
- ✅ Migrated to managed audio system
- ✅ **Removed** the `puck-catch.mp3` sound that was playing on forward movement (major spam source)
- ✅ Only play lateral movement sounds (`puck-left`/`puck-right`) when direction changes
- ✅ Added proper cooldowns and debouncing

### 2. **Stick Check Audio Migration**
**Issue**: Stick swing sounds were creating unmanaged audio instances rapidly.

**Fix**:
- ✅ `SWING_STICK` sound → Managed audio
- ✅ `STICK_CHECK` sound → Managed audio  
- ✅ `STICK_CHECK_MISS` sound → Managed audio
- ✅ `PUCK_ATTACH` on stick check → Managed audio

### 3. **Puck Control Audio Migration**
**Issue**: Pass, shot, and attachment sounds were unmanaged.

**Fix**:
- ✅ `PUCK_ATTACH` sound → Managed audio
- ✅ `PASS_PUCK` sound → Managed audio
- ✅ `WRIST_SHOT` sound → Managed audio

### 4. **Special Move Audio Migration**
**Issue**: Body check and spin move sounds were unmanaged.

**Fix**:
- ✅ `BODY_CHECK` sound → Managed audio
- ✅ `ICE_SKATING` spin sound → Managed audio
- ✅ `WHOOSH` spin sound → Managed audio

### 5. **Enhanced Audio Performance Settings**
**Optimizations**:
- ✅ Reduced cleanup delay: 5s → 3s
- ✅ Reduced max concurrent sounds: 20 → 15
- ✅ Increased global cooldown: 50ms → 100ms
- ✅ Added emergency cleanup thresholds

## 📊 Expected Results

**Before**: 
- 25+ unmanaged audios accumulating rapidly
- 30MB+ estimated memory usage
- Audio degradation after ~1 minute

**After**:
- All frequent sounds managed properly
- Automatic cleanup every 3 seconds
- Emergency cleanup when limits exceeded
- **No more audio accumulation!**

## 🔧 Debug Commands Available

Monitor the fix with these in-game commands:
- `/audioinfo` - See current audio system status
- `/audioworld` - List all audio instances  
- `/audiocleanup` - Force manual cleanup if needed

## 🎯 Key Optimization

The **biggest fix** was removing the `puck-catch.mp3` sound that was playing every time you moved forward while controlling the puck. This was creating dozens of audio instances per second during normal gameplay.

Now you'll only hear:
- `puck-attach.mp3` - **Only** when initially picking up the puck
- `puck-left.mp3` - When dangling left
- `puck-right.mp3` - When dangling right

## 🚀 Test Results Expected

1. **No more 🚨 AUDIO DEGRADATION DETECTED messages**
2. **Managed audio count > Unmanaged audio count**
3. **Total audio instances staying under 15**
4. **Audio working perfectly after 5+ minutes of gameplay**
